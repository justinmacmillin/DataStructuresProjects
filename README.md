DataStructuresProjects
======================

Project 1 - Simulate an ocean containing sharks and fish.
Project 2 - Implement a program that plays the game Network against a human player or another computer program. Network is played on an 8-by-8 board. There are two players, "Black" and "White." Each player has ten chips of its own color to place on the board.
Project 3 - Implement Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm. First implemented a graph data structure to use in the Kruskal's implementation.
