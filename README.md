======================

Folder of projects done in Computer Science 61B, "Data Structures"

Project 1 - Individual project. Simulate an ocean containing sharks and fish. View Ocean.java for shark/fish implementation and RunLengthEncoding.java for viewing ocean implementation.

Project 2 - Group project. Implement a program that plays the game Network against a human player or another computer program. Network is played on an 8-by-8 board. There are two players, "Black" and "White." Each player has ten chips of its own color to place on the board. List package is a self made implementation of a doubly linked list. Network package is a group of test cases given by the professor (Professor Jonathan Shewchuk). Pics package has all of the images for the game board. Within player package (for the parts we programmed as a group) - Board.java implements all legal moves for the game and MachinePlayer.java implements alpha-beta pruning for our machine player choosing the best move on the board. GRADER file documents the work done by the members of our group and includes documentation. 

Project 3 - Group project. Implement Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm. First implemented a graph data structure to use in the Kruskal's implementation. Packages edge, graph, linked, list, and set were all created by us as a group and used to implement Kruskal's. Kruskal.java implements Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm. KruskalTable.java is our own hashtable implementation that can deal with graph objects we created in graph/edge package. KruskalTest.java was given to us to test our algorithm. ListSorts.java is an implementation of Merge Sort to organize edges. WUGTest.java tests our implementation of a weighted, undirected graph. GRADER file documents the work done by the members of our group and includes documentation.
